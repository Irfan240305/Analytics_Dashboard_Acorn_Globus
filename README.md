📊 **Analytics Dashboard UI**

1) A modern and responsive analytics dashboard built as part of the Frontend Developer Internship assignment for Acorn Globus.

2) This project focuses on translating a provided design into a clean, structured, and visually accurate user interface while maintaining good frontend practices.

📌 **About the Project**

1) This dashboard was built to demonstrate my ability to:

2) Convert UI designs into real, functional interfaces

3) Maintain spacing, alignment, and visual consistency

4) Write clean, readable, and scalable frontend code

**The goal was not only to replicate the design but also to ensure the UI feels smooth, responsive, and user-friendly.**

✨ **Key Features**

1) Pixel-aligned layout based on the provided design

2) Responsive layout with flexible containers

3) Interactive charts and UI components

4) Clean and modular code structure

5) Smooth hover effects and transitions

🛠️ **Tech Stack**

- React (Vite) – frontend framework

- JavaScript (ES6+)

- CSS / Tailwind CSS

- Recharts – data visualization

- Vercel – deployment

📱 **Responsiveness**

1) The application is designed with a desktop-first approach while maintaining responsiveness across smaller screen sizes.

2) The layout adapts smoothly to different screen widths, ensuring readability and usability across devices.

📱 **Mobile Responsiveness**

The dashboard is designed with a **responsive layout** that adapts smoothly to different screen sizes.

While the primary focus was on desktop (as per the assignment), the UI also works well on mobile devices:
- Layout adjusts automatically based on screen width  
- Content remains readable and usable on smaller screens  
- Components resize gracefully without breaking the layout  

This ensures a consistent user experience across devices.

🧠 **What I Learned**

1) Translating UI designs into clean, structured layouts

2) Managing layout spacing and responsiveness

3) Structuring components for scalability

4) Improving attention to visual detail

🚧 **Challenges Faced**

1) Maintaining consistent spacing across sections

2) Handling chart responsiveness inside flexible layouts

3) Ensuring layout stability across screen sizes

4) These challenges helped strengthen my understanding of real-world frontend development.

🚀 **Future Improvements**

1) Enhanced mobile navigation experience

2) Improved accessibility (ARIA roles, keyboard support)

3) More animations and micro-interactions

4) Integration with real-time APIs
